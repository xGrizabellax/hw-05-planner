This is a daily planer with interactivity and real time tracking. Plan out your day by putting any activities / to-do's into an hour slot. When that hour is later in the day, it is color-coded "green". If it is the current hour, the hour box will be "red", and if the hour has already passed, the hour box will be grayed-out and will deactivate text input capabilities.
